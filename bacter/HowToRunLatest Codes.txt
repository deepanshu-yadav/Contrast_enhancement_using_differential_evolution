To run the latest codes of our project, follow these steps.


1. Open the following m files in MATLAB. Make sure that all these files would exist at one location.

	bacterialforaging.m
	bact_cellcell_attract_func.m
	nutrientsfunc.m
	mainprogram.m
	member.m 
	program1pld.m

2. Change the following values, if required.

		p=4;     % Dimension of the search space

		S=12;	 % The number of bacteria in the population (for convenience, require this to be an
        		 % an even number)

		Nc=10;   % Number of chemotactic steps per bacteria lifetime (between reproduction steps), assumed
       			 % for convenience to be the same for every bacteria in the population
		Ns=10;   % Limits the length of a swim when it is on a gradient


		Nre=1;	 % The number of reproduction steps (right now the plotting is designed for Nre=4)
		
		Ned=6;	% The number of elimination-dispersal events (Nre reproduction steps in between each event)

3. Change/give the image in the following files.

	mainprogram.m (at line 7)
	program1pld.m (at lines 19 and 94)

4. Now run the bacterialforaging.m program, It gives a set of four parameters.

5. Now copy these four parametrs and paste them in the file program1pld.m at line 10. 
(for Example: params=[7.0000 0.6000 79.7629 2.3188]).

6. Run the program1pld.m code., It gives you the modified image and original images for comparison. 

7. "program1pld.m" also stores the original and modified files. To do this, give the path (at lines 96 & 97) where the images have to be stored.

Note : If you do not want these images to be stored, comment the lines(96 &97) of program1pld.m file.
